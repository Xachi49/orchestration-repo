# Agent governance

Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) before implementing.

- Respect phase boundaries. Do not begin the next phase unless explicitly instructed.
- Never expand scope without explicit instruction.
- Planner cannot authorize.
- Validator cannot execute.
- Executor cannot authorize itself.
- Deterministic authority overrides probabilistic reasoning.
- Fail closed when authority is missing. Do not invent defaults or grants.
- Never introduce external integrations without an explicit milestone.
